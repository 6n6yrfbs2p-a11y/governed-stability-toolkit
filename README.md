# Governed Stability Toolkit

This repository contains a minimal runtime implementation of the governed-stability meta-law:

- Φ̇ ≤ 0 — Energy descent (governed dissipation)
- Ψ̇ ≥ 0 — Information ascent (accessible information growth)
- Λ̇ ≥ 0 — Structural / meaning growth
- Σ̇ ≈ 0 — Governed closure across scales

The goal of this toolkit is to provide:

- Simple reference implementations of the core quantities (Φ, Ψ, Λ, Σ)
- Toy models (e.g. governed black-hole dynamics without singularities)
- Open-data falsification and sanity-check notebooks
- Minimal, transparent code that other researchers can inspect, run, and extend

## Status

- Version: v0.1 (skeleton)
- Core paper: (add your Zenodo DOI link here)
- Black-hole paper: (add your black-hole Zenodo DOI link here)

## How to use (planned)

- `python` / `notebooks` directory with example simulations
- Examples of collapse → core → evaporation under governed stability
- L/M²-based constraints to test candidate black-hole interior models

This repo will be iteratively expanded as the public runtime layer for the governed-stability framework.
